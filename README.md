# ROBLOX SCRIPT EXTENDER (RSE)

Welcome to the Roblox Script Extender (RSE) project! RSE is a tool designed for developers and players that allows users to upload local files into Roblox games. This capability opens up a wide array of opportunities for emulation, modding, customization, and more. **DOWNLOAD AND READ RSE Info.zip**. Most updates will be through that terminal app, not this readme file. ***RSE DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXTEND ROBLOX'S SCRIPTS; IT IS SIMPLY A DLL INJECTOR. THE NAME IS PURELY COSMETIC.***

## HIGHLIGHTED FEATURES

- **Upload Local Files**: Easily upload and integrate local files into Roblox games, enhancing your development experience.
- **Emulation Support**: RSE can be used as a tool for players to use emulators created on roblox.
- **Customization Options**: Modify game features and functionalities to suit your creative vision.

## FUTURE FEATURES

- **OFF-SITE FILE UPLOADS**: Users can safely upload files to a secure website to avoid the risk of being banned for "exploiting."
- **THE ACTUAL RSE FILES**: I plan to upload this, obviously. This might be published with an Unreal emulator for Roblox.

## INSTALLATION AND USAGE

Just download RSE.zip, extract it to where you desire, and run RSE.exe. Wait a couple of seconds for the DLL to inject and then upload the files you want. ***DO NOT CLOSE THE EXE.*** The EXE has a built-in failsafe that automatically uninjects the DLL. You can, however, safely ***MINIMIZE*** the EXE.

***NOTE: THIS IS THE ONLY OFFICIAL SOURCE FOR RSE. ANY OTHER DOWNLOADS CLAIMING TO BE UNMODDED RSE ARE LIKELY MALICIOUS. OTHER DEVS MIGHT MAKE MODDED, BUT SAFE VERSIONS OF RSE.***

## MODIFICATION AND DISTRIBUTION

I don't care what you do with this; just please don't use it for malicious reasons (transfer of viruses or using it as an exploit). I am not responsible for any damage to your PC or any damages to games.

## OPPORTUNITIES 

RSE is currently looking for part-time developers with extensive knowledge of C++. If you're interested in collaborating, please reach out! Please note that there may not be direct compensation at this time, but any proceeds from RSE will be divided evenly among contributors if applicable.

## CONTACT

For questions, suggestions, or contributions, please contact me on Discord (KumottaTenki).
